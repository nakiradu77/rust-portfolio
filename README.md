## Portfolio personnel

**Maxime Loukhal - Embedded Software engineer**

An high-performance, single-page portfolio and low latency.

## Stack Architecture

- **Core:** Rust (Compiled to WebAssembly)
- **Framework:** Leptos v0.7 (Client-Side Rendered)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 + Vanilla CSS
- **Animations:** GSAP (Timeline & ScrollTrigger) + Lenis Smooth Scroll
- **Toolchain:** Trunk

## Zero-Latency Static Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This project compiles into raw WebAssembly and static CSS/HTML. It requires absolutely no backend infrastructure, making it perfect for free hosting on GitHub Pages via Actions.

### How to Deploy:

1. Push this code to a repository (`nakiradu77/rust-portfolio`) on GitHub.
2. Go to your repository **Settings** > **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, change the **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Create a new file in your repository at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content to automatically build and deploy your WebAssembly portfolio:

```yaml
name: Deploy Trunk Build to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["trunk"]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Rust
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
        with:
          targets: wasm32-unknown-unknown

      - name: Install Trunk
        uses: jetli/trunk-action@v0.5.0
        with:
          version: 'latest'

      - name: Build
        run: trunk build --release --public-url /rust-portfolio/

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: 'dist'

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

Once this file is committed to your `trunk` branch, GitHub will automatically build your site and host it at `https:/nakiradu77.github.io/rust-portfolio/`.

## Local Development

```bash
# Add WebAssembly target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install Trunk
cargo install trunk

# Run development server (with hot reload)
trunk serve --open
```

## 🛠️ Forking & Customizing (Open Source)

This portfolio is open source and free to use! 

Because the entire architecture is statically compiled, **you do not need to touch any Rust code to customize this site for yourself.**

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Edit `content.json`:** Open the `content.json` file in the root directory. All of the text, projects, skills, and links on the website are pulled directly from this file at compile time. Just replace my data with yours!
3. **Change the SEO Data:** Open `index.html` and swap out the meta tags, `<title>`, and descriptions with your own information.
4. **Deploy:** Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions), and GitHub will automatically build and publish your customized portfolio.
